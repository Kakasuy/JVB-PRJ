# Project Overview - Chisfis Template Clone

## Project Purpose
This is a **travel booking platform** called "Chisfis" - a React Next.js template for online booking and rental services. The platform supports multiple booking categories:

- **Hotels/Stays** - Primary focus with Amadeus Hotel API integration
- **Cars** - Rental car booking
- **Experiences** - Activity and experience booking  
- **Flights** - Flight booking
- **Real Estate** - Property rental/booking

## Key Features
- Multi-category booking platform (stays, cars, experiences, flights, real estate)
- Amadeus Hotel API integration for real hotel data
- Location-based search with Google Maps integration
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- User authentication and account management
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Interactive maps for listings
- Review and rating system

## Business Context
The project appears to be a clone/adaptation of the Chisfis booking template, customized with real API integrations (particularly Amadeus for hotel data). It's designed as a full-featured travel booking website similar to Airbnb, Booking.com, or Expedia.

## Current Status
- Active development with recent commits for task filtering and section improvements
- Production-ready with proper build/deployment configuration
- Amadeus API integration documented and implemented
- Comprehensive component library and design system in place
